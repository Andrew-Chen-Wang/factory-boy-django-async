# Django ORM Template

A GitHub template to quickly get a Python project
that needs an awesome ORM up and running.
This repository is a quick template repository
that I personally use.

Original intended usage is to script from main.py
and call management commands through manage.py

To run tests, run `pytest tests/`

Includes support for:
- Either SQLite or PostgreSQL
- Docker
- Pre-commit

This repository is performing:
- Unittests to upgrade Django fast
